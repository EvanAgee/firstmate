# task-lifecycle-reference

This skill holds the section 7 procedures moved out of `AGENTS.md` word for word, so "always-loaded" and "this section" below describe `AGENTS.md` section 7 itself.
`AGENTS.md` section 7 keeps the merge and yolo authority rules, the validation ownership rules, and the skill triggers inline; section numbers below refer to `AGENTS.md`.

## Intake and authority

The delivery lifecycle is an always-loaded operational contract; referenced scripts own exact commands, flags, and data mechanics.

Classify the deliverable:

- **Ship** is the default and produces a project change through the selected delivery mode; once implementation is authorized, dispatch a ship and keep any remaining bounded research inside it unless unresolved uncertainty could materially change whether or what to build.
- **Scout** produces knowledge in `data/<id>/report.md`, never a PR, and is appropriate for investigation, diagnosis, planning, reproduction, or audit work when the captain explicitly requests a separate knowledge or design deliverable or unresolved uncertainty could materially change whether or what to build.

An explicit project wins, a clear follow-up inherits its referent, and otherwise match the request against the registry, work under way, and project code or README.
Proceed on one confident match while naming the project in plain language; ask one concise question when multiple or no projects plausibly match.
If no secondmate scope fits, use the main home or discuss creating an appropriate persistent secondmate.
For one-off or infrequent operational work, start with the simplest direct end-to-end path.
Do not build wrappers, control planes, policy layers, custom verifiers, or automation unless the direct path exposes a concrete blocker or repeated need that justifies the added machinery.

Before commissioning an investigation, consult existing reports and established evidence.
If established evidence already answers an informational question, relay it without a design-only scout; when implementation intent is unclear, answer and ask one concise implementation question when useful rather than dispatching speculative design work.
Never both present a likely-enough solution and launch a parallel design exercise that is not expected to change it.

On a `no-mistakes-prod-only` project, classify the task's surface: internal-only tooling, automation, contributor or operator process, and release or submission work ships `direct-PR`, while product-facing, mixed, and uncertain work ships `no-mistakes`; never infer internal-only from file location or project name.
Record the resulting mode, yolo, and the one-line reason for any deviation in the backlog item note.

Treat file or subsystem overlap as a risk signal rather than an automatic reason to wait, and dispatch isolated work immediately with no concurrency cap when each change can be independently implemented and validated and the selected delivery path can reconcile ordinary rebases or conflicts.
Serialize only for a true semantic dependency, shared mutable external state, incompatible concurrent migration, or another concrete condition that makes independent progress or reconciliation unsafe; same-file editing alone is insufficient, and genuine blockers remain durable.

## Briefs

`bin/fm-brief.sh` and its help own scaffold syntax, generated variants, status protocol, delivery-mode definitions of done, and exact safety mechanics.
Use its scaffold as the contract, then replace every `{TASK}` placeholder with a clear task description, acceptance criteria, constraints, and necessary context before dispatch or seeding.
Keep additions task-specific rather than repeating lifecycle instructions, and alter generated sections only when the task genuinely differs from the standard shape.

## Dispatch and steering

After spawning, confirm the worker is processing the brief, handle any trust dialog through `harness-adapters`, and record ship or scout work as under way.
A persistent secondmate is recorded in the secondmate registry and runtime state, never as a backlog work item.
Steer a worker with short single-line messages through fail-closed `fm-send`; put long instructions in a file.
A secondmate's routed reply returns through status or a document pointer, not by firstmate peeking into its chat.
For the parent-owned correlation, recovery, and escalation contract on marked secondmate requests, see `bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh`.
Supervise all live work under section 8.

## Selected delivery path

The selected delivery path owns its own rigor.
When no-mistakes is selected, no-mistakes alone owns review, fixes, tests, documentation, push, PR, and CI; otherwise follow the faster path without adding an independent reviewer.
Never hold work outside no-mistakes for a manual clean verdict, stack serial manual reviews, or infer authority for one from security, architecture, or risk alone.
A separate review or audit is allowed only when the captain explicitly requests that deliverable or the authorized task is a knowledge-only review; one named question remains scoped to that question.
If fast-path risk needs more rigor, escalate whether to use no-mistakes instead of inventing a manual gate.
The path's worker, automated gates, and captain approval remain authoritative:

- **no-mistakes** runs the full pipeline through a PR, then waits for the configured merge authority.
- **direct-PR** has the worker push and open a PR without the no-mistakes pipeline, then waits for the configured merge authority.
- **local-only** has the worker stop with a clean ready branch, then waits for the configured merge authority before firstmate uses the guarded fast-forward merge path.
`AGENTS.md` section 7 and `outage-local-landing` add one exception to these review limits: the adversarial review a yolo-on outage auto-land requires.

After an autonomous merge, give the captain a one-line full-URL or local-main outcome.

## Validate

For a no-mistakes ship, the ship brief has the worker start validation itself on the same worker after its implementation commit; do not send a separate validation trigger.
If a worker stalls after its implementation commit instead of starting validation, steer it into the run with the harness invocation owned by `harness-adapters`.
Once validation starts, prefer routing new requirements to follow-up work rather than expanding the current task, unless a new requirement completely invalidates the work being validated; however, the smallest downstream changes needed to keep already accepted product or engineering behavior correct, add behavioral tests where an executable contract exists, or keep documentation accurate remain within the current task even when they touch files not named at intake, and corrections required to satisfy already accepted intent are not new requirements.

`AGENTS.md` section 7 keeps the task with the same worker only when a current, explicit captain instruction completely invalidates the work being validated; in that case:
That worker cancels the active run through no-mistakes axi's supported abort command and confirms through axi status that the run has stopped before changing any code.
The worker then follows `branch_sync.next_action` from structured axi status: use axi sync's supported guarded recovery only when its code is `recover_custody`, and otherwise proceed only when structured status confirms that branch ownership is already returned and no recovery is required.
Custody recovery settles branch ownership, not content: the worker must replace the obsolete work from the correct pre-invalidation base rather than building on top of the recovered-but-obsolete head, keeping the obsolete run's own pipeline-fix commits out of what gets validated and shipped.
Once ownership is settled, validate exactly once against that final head so no obsolete or intermediate head is ever treated as authoritative.

Send the same worker one exact decision naming the decision key, step, action, affected finding IDs, instructions where needed, and exact response command, passing `--resolve-key` so the worker's open decision record closes at answer time.
Resume fleet supervision immediately after the decision lands.
Running, fixing, or CI states remain working; parked approval or fix-review states require the worker to follow the active gate help; passed or checks-passed is done; failed or cancelled is failed.
A worker hand-editing, committing, aborting, or restarting during an active validation run duplicates pipeline ownership outside the supersession sequence above; steer it back to the gate response flow.
The worker reports the PR when CI first becomes green rather than waiting for merge monitoring to finish.

## PR ready, landing, and teardown

For PR-based ship tasks, the ready signal depends on mode: `no-mistakes` reports `done: PR <url> checks green` after CI is green, while `direct-PR` reports `done: PR <url>` after opening the PR.
`bin/fm-pr-autoarm.sh` automatically arms the merge poll when that status line contains one canonical GitHub pull request or GitLab merge request URL, and its delayed exact-branch scan recovers missed announcements through `bin/fm-pr-check.sh`.
Successful links stay silent.
Run `bin/fm-pr-check.sh <id> <PR url>` directly only when that PR is confirmed for the task and its watch is missing.
A captain instruction to merge is explicit authority; `yolo` is the only standing routine authority.
For any custom `state/<id>.check.sh` you write yourself, keep it an ordinary single-link mode-`0700` file, print one line only when firstmate should wake, print nothing otherwise, finish before `FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT`, then bind its current bytes with `bin/fm-check-register.sh <id>` before the watcher may execute it.
To watch one GitHub Actions run to completion, arm `bin/fm-ci-watch.sh` instead of writing that check by hand.

Tear down a ship task only after landing is confirmed.
A teardown refusal for uncommitted or unlanded work is a stop-and-investigate result, never an obstacle to bypass.
Never force teardown without explicit discard authority.
After successful teardown, record completion, retain only the configured recent Done history, and re-evaluate queued work whose blockers and time gates have cleared.

## Scout outcome and promotion

Before treating the investigation or any visual review as complete, load `decision-hold-lifecycle`; teardown enforces that shared completion gate.
The promoted worker must inventory scratch state, return to a clean default-branch base, carry over only intended fix changes, create the ship branch, and follow the project's selected delivery path while leaving scratch commits and debug edits behind and turning a reproduced bug into the regression test.

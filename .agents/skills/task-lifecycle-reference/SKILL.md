# 7. Task lifecycle

### Intake and authority

An explicit project wins, a clear follow-up inherits its referent, and otherwise match the request against the registry, work under way, and project code or README.
Proceed on one confident match while naming the project in plain language; ask one concise question when multiple or no projects plausibly match.

Route by the nature of the work against each registered secondmate scope, not by a non-exclusive clone list.
Keep `local-only` work in the main home.
Send in-scope work to the fitting secondmate unless it is blocked or the captain explicitly redirects it; do not read the secondmate's chat because marked routed replies return through its status or referenced document.
If no secondmate scope fits, use the main home or discuss creating an appropriate persistent secondmate.
For one-off or infrequent operational work, start with the simplest direct end-to-end path.
Do not build wrappers, control planes, policy layers, custom verifiers, or automation unless the direct path exposes a concrete blocker or repeated need that justifies the added machinery.

Before commissioning an investigation, consult existing reports and established evidence.
Classify the deliverable:

- **Ship** is the default and produces a project change through the selected delivery mode; once implementation is authorized, dispatch a ship and keep any remaining bounded research inside it unless unresolved uncertainty could materially change whether or what to build.
- **Scout** produces knowledge in `data/<id>/report.md`, never a PR, and is appropriate for investigation, diagnosis, planning, reproduction, or audit work when the captain explicitly requests a separate knowledge or design deliverable or unresolved uncertainty could materially change whether or what to build.

If established evidence already answers an informational question, relay it without a design-only scout; when implementation intent is unclear, answer and ask one concise implementation question when useful rather than dispatching speculative design work.
Never both present a likely-enough solution and launch a parallel design exercise that is not expected to change it.

On a `no-mistakes-prod-only` project, classify the task's surface: internal-only tooling, automation, contributor or operator process, and release or submission work ships `direct-PR`, while product-facing, mixed, and uncertain work ships `no-mistakes`; never infer internal-only from file location or project name.
Record the resulting mode, `yolo` merge posture, and the one-line reason for any deviation in the backlog item note.

Treat file or subsystem overlap as a risk signal rather than an automatic reason to wait, and dispatch isolated work immediately with no concurrency cap when each change can be independently implemented and validated and the selected delivery path can reconcile ordinary rebases or conflicts.
Serialize only for a true semantic dependency, shared mutable external state, incompatible concurrent migration, or another concrete condition that makes independent progress or reconciliation unsafe; same-file editing alone is insufficient, and genuine blockers remain durable.

### Dispatch and supervision handoff

When the configured tasks-axi backlog gate applies, the spawn itself moves the work item to In flight and refuses rather than dispatching work this home has no item for, so recording the dispatch is never a separate step to remember; a manual-backend home retains the hand-editing contract in `docs/configuration.md`.
After spawning, confirm the worker is processing the brief and handle any trust dialog through `harness-adapters`.
A persistent secondmate is recorded in the secondmate registry and runtime state, never as a backlog work item.

Steer a worker with ordinary text through fail-closed `fm-send`: the message becomes a durable record in the task's steering inbox (multi-line text is legal, local and remote alike) and the worker's terminal receives only a constant doorbell line, with the watcher re-ringing an unacknowledged local message and escalating a stuck one (`bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh`; `bin/fm-send.sh` owns the typed-plane carve-outs).
A remote secondmate steer rides the same durable-inbox model through the remote transport; after an unconfirmed delivery, only the exact `FM_PENDING_REPLY_EXISTING_CORR=<id>` resend command printed by `fm-send` is safe because it preserves the request body for remote enqueue deduplication (`bin/fm-send.sh` header).
When a steer answers an open keyed decision or blocker, pass `fm-send`'s `--resolve-key` so the answer itself closes that decision record at answer time, identically for local and remote workers (contract: `bin/fm-send.sh` header).
A secondmate's routed reply returns through status or a document pointer, not by firstmate peeking into its chat.
For the parent-owned correlation, recovery, and escalation contract on marked secondmate requests, see `bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh`.

### Selected delivery path and merge authority

The selected delivery path owns its own rigor.
When no-mistakes is selected, no-mistakes alone owns review, fixes, tests, documentation, push, PR, and CI; otherwise follow the faster path without adding an independent reviewer.
Never hold work outside no-mistakes for a manual clean verdict, stack serial manual reviews, or infer authority for one from security, architecture, or risk alone.
A separate review or audit is allowed only when the captain explicitly requests that deliverable or the authorized task is a knowledge-only review; one named question remains scoped to that question.
If fast-path risk needs more rigor, escalate whether to use no-mistakes instead of inventing a manual gate.

Delivery mode and `yolo` are orthogonal.
`yolo` governs merge authority only: with it off, the captain approves every PR merge and every local-only landing; with it on, firstmate merges green, in-scope work itself.
Never merge a red PR under either setting unless a current explicit captain instruction names the single GitHub check waived through `fm-pr-merge.sh --allow-red`; that attended-only waiver still requires every other check green.
Destructive, irreversible, and security-sensitive merges still escalate.
Without a current explicit captain instruction that states the concrete merge, the green default stands, and standing `yolo` cannot authorize a red merge; section 1 owns when such an instruction overrides a Firstmate-written standing rule within its exact scope.
Use `bin/fm-pr-merge.sh` for every task PR merge so merge metadata is recorded and an unproved merge is refused instead of reported as landed, and use `bin/fm-merge-local.sh` for approved local-only landing; never call a lower-level merge command around their guards.
After an autonomous merge, give the captain a one-line full-URL or local-main outcome.

### Validate

For a no-mistakes ship, trigger validation on the same worker after its implementation commit, using the harness invocation owned by `harness-adapters`.
When the captain adds or changes an ask mid-task, append the captain's words without added speaker labels or direct address to that brief's `## Captain's intent` and relay those words to the worker; Firstmate build constraints stay in `## Firstmate spec` or the steer.
`bin/fm-dod-lib.sh` owns the worker-side `--intent` contract.
Once validation starts, prefer routing new requirements to follow-up work rather than expanding the current task, unless a new requirement completely invalidates the work being validated; however, the smallest downstream changes needed to keep already accepted product or engineering behavior correct, add behavioral tests where an executable contract exists, or keep documentation accurate remain within the current task even when they touch files not named at intake, and corrections required to satisfy already accepted intent are not new requirements.

Only a current, explicit captain instruction that completely invalidates the work being validated keeps the task with the same worker instead of routing it to follow-up work or handing it to a replacement.
That worker cancels the active run through no-mistakes axi's supported abort command and confirms through axi status that the run has stopped before changing any code.
The worker then follows `branch_sync.next_action` from structured axi status: use axi sync's supported guarded recovery only when its code is `recover_custody`, and otherwise proceed only when structured status confirms that branch ownership is already returned and no recovery is required.
Custody recovery settles branch ownership, not content: the worker must replace the obsolete work from the correct pre-invalidation base rather than building on top of the recovered-but-obsolete head, keeping the obsolete run's own pipeline-fix commits out of what gets validated and shipped.
Apart from that single supported abort, do not hand-edit, commit, restart, or start a second validation run while the obsolete run still owns the branch.
Once ownership is settled, validate exactly once against that final head so no obsolete or intermediate head is ever treated as authoritative.

Send the same worker one exact decision naming the decision key, step, action, affected finding IDs, instructions where needed, and exact response command, passing `--resolve-key` so the worker's open decision record closes at answer time.
Require the matching `resolved` event, forbid `--yes`, and require the worker to process every synchronous return until completion or a genuinely new escalation.
Resume fleet supervision immediately after the decision lands.

Running, fixing, or CI states remain working; parked approval or fix-review states require the worker to follow the active gate help; passed or checks-passed is done; failed or cancelled is failed exactly as `bin/fm-crew-state.sh` prints it - only that state line reclassifies an orphaned ci monitor after green checks as held-for-merge done, or a run record the `daemon status` probe leaves unverified as unknown, never the raw run record.
A worker hand-editing, committing, aborting, or restarting during an active validation run duplicates pipeline ownership outside the supersession sequence above; steer it back to the gate response flow.
The worker reports the PR when CI first becomes green rather than waiting for merge monitoring to finish.

### PR ready, landing, and teardown

For PR-based ship tasks, the ready signal depends on mode: `no-mistakes` reports `done [at=<epoch>]: PR <url> checks green` after CI is green, while `direct-PR` reports `done [at=<epoch>]: PR <url>` after opening the PR, each only for a non-draft PR; a lane that deliberately holds a draft declares a wait instead, and `bin/fm-pr-check.sh` refuses to arm merge monitoring on a draft.
Run `bin/fm-pr-check.sh <id> <PR url>` with the URL copied from that ready signal - it records `pr=` and the forge's `pr_head=` when available in the task's meta and arms the watcher's merge poll.
Tell the captain the PR's full `https://...` URL copied from the worker's ready line or the task's `pr=` metadata, a concise outcome summary, and the no-mistakes risk level when applicable.
For any custom `state/<id>.check.sh` you write yourself, keep it an ordinary single-link mode-`0700` file, print one line only when firstmate should wake, print nothing otherwise, finish before `FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT`, then bind its current bytes with `bin/fm-check-register.sh <id>` before the watcher may execute it.
Retire a custom check only through `bin/fm-check-unregister.sh <id>` (or `bin/fm-teardown.sh` for a spawned task); never hand-compose an `rm` with `$STATE`/`$ID`.

After successful teardown, record completion, retain only the configured recent Done history, and re-evaluate queued work whose blockers and time gates have cleared.

A secondmate is persistent and an empty queue is healthy.
Retire one only on an explicit captain or main-firstmate decision, after loading `secondmate-provisioning`; its home must contain no work under way, and forced discard still requires explicit captain authority.

### Scout outcome and promotion

When a scout's deliverable is a visual artifact the captain will iterate on, keep it alive and follow the crew-hosted Lavish board contract in `docs/configuration.md` rather than arming or polling the board from firstmate.
The promoted worker must inventory scratch state, return to a clean default-branch base, carry over only intended fix changes, create the ship branch, and follow the project's selected delivery path while leaving scratch commits and debug edits behind and turning a reproduced bug into the regression test.

# session-start-reference

`AGENTS.md` section 3 keeps the lock, read-once, network-check, and bootstrap-consent rules inline; this skill holds the digest map moved out of it word for word.
Section numbers below refer to `AGENTS.md`.

`bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh` renders the emitted supervision block from `docs/supervision-protocols/`.
`secondmate-provisioning` owns startup secondmate sync, liveness, and inherited local-material convergence.
Treat digest status tails as wake-event history and use targeted current-state reconciliation when the live state matters.
Honor lock-refused read-only mode exactly as section 3 requires.
Run the session-start `export CHROME_DEVTOOLS_AXI_MCP_PATH=...` before the first `chrome-devtools-axi` command so this shell inherits the pinned launcher.

The digest itself makes no external-network call and never waits for one.
Every network check a session start owes - GitHub auth, dead-secondmate relaunch, secondmate convergence, pending handoff delivery, and project clone refresh - runs concurrently in a bounded worker owned by `bin/fm-startup-network.sh` and is reported in the digest's own `NETWORK CHECKS` section.
When that section reports its checks still in progress it names exactly what is unconfirmed; treat none of those as passed until the result lands, either from `bin/fm-startup-network.sh report` or as a `check: startup-network` wake.

1. **Lock** - acquires the per-home session lock first, before anything mutates shared state, then starts the deferred network stage above.
2. **Bootstrap** - detect-only checks (tool/version problems, the worktree-tangle check, harness override, dispatch-profile validation, backlog-backend status) always run, but routine confirmations stay silent by default.
   When the lock could not be acquired, the worktree-tangle check uses read-only advisory wording without a checkout repair command.
   Home-local stale Herdr projection cleanup and the six bootstrap MUTATING sweeps - non-executing legacy PR-check migration, fleet sync, secondmate convergence, secondmate liveness, pending remote handoff retry, and Relay artifact writes - run only when this session actually holds the lock from step 1; the four network ones among them run in the deferred stage rather than in this section.
   The secondmate liveness sweep deterministically accounts for every registered secondmate: it relaunches only from the recovery-grade `dead` or `missing` states, preserves ambiguous, unreadable, or unreachable remote targets, and reports skipped or failed guarantees as `SECONDMATE_LIVENESS:` lines (`bin/fm-bootstrap.sh`; `bin/fm-backend.sh`'s `fm_backend_agent_state`; `docs/remote-secondmates.md`).
3. **Wake queue** - when locked, presents the durable wake queue and prints the raw records prominently as this turn's first work queue; a clearly labeled status-event annotation may follow a valid `signal` record and includes every status line still unread at the presentation cursor, but never replaces the raw record or current-state reconciliation, and a lapsed watcher chain still surfaces here via the same guard alarm.
   Presented records remain durable until the handling turn runs the generation-bound acknowledgement printed by the drain.
   Every locked drain also prints a bounded fleet-wide `OPEN DECISIONS` section when durable decision records remain open, including when the queue itself is empty; reconcile those entries before continuing.
   The same drain prints every still-unread `note:` line and pending-reply resolution since the last presentation in an unbounded `UNREAD STATUS` section, so an answer buried under a later routine line is not dropped; those lines are not re-printed after that presentation.
   When the lock could not be acquired and verified, the queue is left untouched because no session mutation is authorized, and the guard's tangle/watcher-liveness alarms still print in read-only advisory mode without drain, supervision repair, or checkout repair commands.
4. **Supervision operating instructions** - after the wake queue and before both digests, the digest emits exactly one operating block for the detected primary harness, followed by the read-once contract that governs them.
   The script itself never starts supervision; the emitted harness protocol owns the exact wait or wake mechanism.
5. **Fleet-state digest** - after that read-once contract and ahead of the context digest, the compact backlog listing owned by `bin/fm-session-start.sh`; every `state/<id>.meta`; a bounded tail of each task's `state/<id>.status` (labeled as wake-EVENT history, not current state, with the full log path printed for a deeper read); the `state/.afk` flag; and one cheap alive/dead read of each task's recorded backend endpoint.
   That liveness line is a fast presence check only, not a full state read - when you need a crew's actual current state (a run-step, not just "is the pane there"), read it with `bin/fm-crew-state.sh <id>` as before; the digest deliberately skips that deeper, slower read for every task so it stays fast and bounded.
6. **Network checks** - after the fleet-state digest, the deferred stage's result, or an explicit statement of what it has not confirmed yet.
   A read-only session runs no network checks at all and says so.
7. **Context digest and next step** - last of the bulk sections, the full contents of `data/projects.md`, `data/secondmates.md`, `data/captain.md`, `data/captain-shared.md`, and `data/learnings.md`, each clearly delimited, followed by the closing reminder.
   A file that does not exist prints an explicit `ABSENT` marker, never confused with an empty-but-present file: absence is meaningful (`captain.md` absent means use the firstmate repo's built-in defaults, `projects.md` absent means rebuild it from the clones under `projects/`, etc.).
   The closing reminder points back to the emitted supervision block and preserves only the lock, afk, Relay, and read-once reminders.

An `ABSENT` captain, shared-captain, secondmate, or learnings file means the firstmate repo's built-in defaults, no shared captain preferences, no registered secondmates, or no captured learnings; rebuild an absent or stale project registry from the clones before dispatch.
